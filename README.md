Satellite Tracker
======

Github Repo of the satellite tracker built by AAC NITK as part of Astro Committee for Engineer 2016 and Engineer 2017.

_**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** We are actively working on this Roadmap._

## Proposed updates for 2017

* **Step 1.** `LEAP FROGGED` Remake 2016 Version  
* **Step 2.** **[IN PROGRESS]** Create base with DC motor for tracking azimuth ( one axis ) 
* **Step 3.** `DONE` Get data the from sensor on the Arduino Nano.
Notes: Magnetometer Y axis isn't working. Using X and Z axis for orientation.
* **Step 4.** `DONE` Connect Arduino Nano to python server through Bluetooh
* **Step 5.** `NEXT STEP` Make Feedback loop controller for azimuth
* **Step 6.** DO same for elevation (second axis)
